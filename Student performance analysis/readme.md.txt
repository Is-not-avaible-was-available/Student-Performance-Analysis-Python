🧮 Student Performance Analysis
🎯 Project Overview

This project explores how various demographic and socio-economic factors such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation influence students’ academic performance in Math, Reading, and Writing.
The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that can help understand student outcomes better.
